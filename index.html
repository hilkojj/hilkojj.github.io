            <h1>About</h1>

            After playing games like Anno 1404, Age of Empires and Civilization I fantasized about making a similar game
            that takes place on a spherical earth instead of a flat earth.

            <br>

            I've had this idea for several years until recently I actually started working on it.

            <br><br>

            The game is made in my <a href="https://github.com/hilkojj/cpp-game-utils" title="GitHub repository"
                target="_blank">own C++ game engine using OpenGL</a>. I've learnt <i>a lot</i> about rendering 3D
            graphics during this (unfinished) project.

            <h1>Water rendering</h1>

            Initially I had zero experience writing 3D shaders, so the water shader was quite a challenge to make.
            Making this water shader for a spherical surface, instead of a flat one, made this even harder.
            <br><br>
            After learning about water caustics, reflections, the fresnel effect etc. I finally got to this result, of
            which the breakdown can be seen in the video.

            <h1>Island generation</h1>

            The video shows how the islands/continents in the game are generated.
            <br><br>
            Originally I started programming the game in Java (with LibGDX), but after I rewrote the whole thing in C++, the island generation became 20(!) times faster.
            <br>
            This was one of my motivations to rewrite the whole game in C++, which also gave a <i>huge</i> FPS boost.

            <h1>Ship pathfinding</h1>

            Ships in the game are able to travel around the world.
            <br>
            To make this possible there needs to be some sort of navigation graph.
            <br><br>
            For this, I made a icosphere generator that cuts out the islands, and subdivides triangles close to the coastline one extra time to give extra pathfinding precision. (see image for icospghere)

            <br><br>
            With this 3d graph you can use pathfinding algoritms, like A*, to find a path from A to B.
            <br>
            This path is then smoothed out to mask out sharp angles etc.

            <h1>Buildings & instanced rendering</h1>

            In the video you can see how buildings (only houses & trees for now) are being placed on an island grid.
            
            <br><br>
            To render the trees and other buildings I use instanced rendering.
            <br>
            That means that thousands of trees can be rendered in only 1 draw call instead of thousands.
            This eliminates the waiting time between CPU and GPU and therefore greatly increases peformance.
